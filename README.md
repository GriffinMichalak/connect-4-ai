# ai-final-project

Goal: Code different AI algorithms for Connect 4 (Reinforcement Learning, Minimax, AlphaBeta Pruning, Monte Carlo Tree Search, etc.) and compare/contrast them.

Steps:
1. Connect 4 interface
2. Create different AI strategies
3. Make it playable
4. Add a graphical interface
5. Write up project report
6. Slides

AI Algorithms:
- Minimax w/ AlphaBeta Pruning
- Monte Carlo Tree Search
- Reinforcement Learning
- Simple Heuristic Search

## Useful Commands

Running Program
```sh
.venv/bin/python demo.py # if your environment name is .venv
```

Deleting pyc files
```sh
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
```
